### 4B/5B Encoding Algorithm Overview

The 4B/5B encoding scheme is a line encoding method used primarily in data communication systems, including Ethernet and Fast Ethernet, to maintain reliable and efficient data transmission. This method is used in the Physical Layer of the OSI model. Here's a breakdown of how it works, starting with a simple explanation and moving into more details.

#### **1\. Basic Principle**

*   In 4B/5B encoding, each 4-bit block of data is mapped to a corresponding 5-bit code.
*   This conversion increases the data size slightly, but it is done to ensure that specific desirable properties are maintained in the data stream.

#### **2\. Purpose of 4B/5B Encoding**

*   **Maintain Synchronization**: Transmitting binary signals over long distances can lead to synchronization issues. 4B/5B encoding reduces the possibility of long sequences of 0s, which are problematic for synchronization.
*   **Ensure a Minimum Transition Density**: A minimum number of signal transitions (from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1) are guaranteed. This helps the receiver’s clock remain synchronized with the transmitter.
*   **Prevent DC Bias**: By maintaining a balanced stream of 1s and 0s, the encoding helps avoid DC bias in the transmission medium, which can distort the signal.

#### **3\. How 4B/5B Encoding Works**

*   Each 4-bit block is converted into a 5-bit block according to a predefined mapping.
*   This mapping is designed such that no 5-bit code will have more than three consecutive zeros. This guarantees enough transitions in the signal for clock recovery.
*   Unused 5-bit codes are reserved for control signals or are left unused to avoid patterns that could cause errors.

#### **4\. Step-by-Step Explanation**

*   **Step 1**: Take a 4-bit block from the data stream. For example, `1010`.
*   **Step 2**: Refer to the 4B/5B encoding table to find the corresponding 5-bit code for `1010`. Let's say it maps to `11000`.
*   **Step 3**: Transmit the 5-bit code over the medium.
*   **Step 4**: The receiver, upon receiving `11000`, will look up the encoding table and retrieve the original 4-bit data, `1010`.
*   **Step 5**: Repeat the process for each 4-bit block in the data stream.

#### **5\. Example of 4B/5B Encoding Table**

Here’s a small part of a typical 4B/5B encoding table for illustration:

| 4-bit Input | 5-bit Output |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 0000        | 11110        |
| 0001        | 01001        |
| 0010        | 10100        |
| 0011        | 10101        |
| 0100        | 01010        |
| 0101        | 01011        |
| 0110        | 01110        |
| 0111        | 01111        |
| 1000        | 10010        |
| 1001        | 10011        |
| 1010        | 11000        |
| 1011        | 11001        |
| 1100        | 11010        |
| 1101        | 11011        |
| 1110        | 11100        |
| 1111        | 11101        |
