### Detailed Description of the MLT-3 Algorithm

The Multilevel Transmission (MLT-3) algorithm is a line coding scheme primarily used in data transmission over communication channels. Its purpose is to reduce the bandwidth required to transmit digital signals, making it ideal for applications where bandwidth efficiency is critical, such as in Ethernet (Fast Ethernet, specifically 100BASE-TX).

MLT-3 is a three-level signaling method that cycles through three voltage levels:

1. **Positive Voltage (+V)**
2. **Zero Voltage (0)**
3. **Negative Voltage (-V)**

#### Key Concepts

1. **Three Signal Levels**: MLT-3 uses three distinct voltage levels: positive, zero, and negative. This reduces the frequency of voltage changes compared to binary signaling, which typically switches between just two levels (e.g., +V and -V).

2. **Transition Rule**: MLT-3 transitions to the next voltage level only when a "1" bit is encountered in the data. For a "0" bit, the current level is maintained without any change.

3. **Transition Cycle**: The signal levels cycle in a specific sequence: **0 → +V → 0 → -V → 0**. After reaching -V, the signal returns to 0 and repeats this cycle.

4. **Reduced Bandwidth**: Because MLT-3 does not transition for every bit, it results in fewer signal changes compared to standard binary schemes. This reduction in frequency decreases the overall bandwidth requirement, making it suitable for higher-speed data transmission over certain media.

#### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initial State**: The transmission begins at the zero voltage level (0V).

2. **Reading the Bit**: The algorithm reads the input bit. If it is "0," the voltage level remains unchanged. If it is "1," a transition occurs.

3. **Transition for "1"**:

    * From **0**: It transitions to **+V**.
    * From **+V**: It transitions back to **0**.
    * From **0**: It transitions to **\-V**.
    * From **\-V**: It transitions back to **0**.
4. **No Transition for "0"**: When the input bit is "0," the signal stays at the current voltage level.

MLT-3 follows a simple, repetitive pattern. For every "1," it cycles to the next voltage level in this sequence: 0→+V→0→−V→00 \\rightarrow +V \\rightarrow 0 \\rightarrow -V \\rightarrow 00→+V→0→−V→0.
