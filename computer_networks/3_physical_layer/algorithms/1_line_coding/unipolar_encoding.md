### Unipolar Encoding Algorithm: Detailed Description

**1\. Introduction to Unipolar Encoding:** Unipolar encoding is a line coding scheme used in digital communication systems, where binary data is represented by only two voltage levels, usually with one level being zero or ground. This is a straightforward and basic approach, ideal for simple and low-cost systems but not as robust as more advanced encoding techniques.

In a typical unipolar encoding scheme:

* **Bit `1`** is represented by a positive voltage (often denoted as `+V`).
* **Bit `0`** is represented by zero voltage (`0`).

For example:

* A signal with values `[1, 0, 1, 1, 0]` would be transmitted as `[+V, 0, +V, +V, 0]`.

**2\. Characteristics of Unipolar Encoding:**

* **Single voltage level**: Since the encoding uses only a single positive voltage and zero, it's called _unipolar_.
* **Simplistic Design**: This simplicity makes it easy to implement, especially in systems where cost is a concern.
* **Signal Transmission Efficiency**: It's not efficient because half of the bits are represented by zero voltage (no signal is transmitted), which does not effectively utilize bandwidth.
* **DC Component**: The presence of long sequences of `0`s creates a DC component that could cause synchronization issues and baseline wandering.

**3\. How Unipolar Encoding Works:**

* **Binary `1`** is represented by a high voltage (+V).
* **Binary `0`** is represented by zero voltage (0V).
* Each bit occupies a fixed time period known as the _bit duration_.
* The signal alternates between +V and 0 based on the binary data sequence.

### Summary

In each of these examples, the unipolar encoding approach is applied by assigning `+V` to binary `1` and `0V` to binary `0`. The patterns show how this encoding handles various data sequences, highlighting its simplicity and limitations, especially with continuous sequences of zeros that cause synchronization issues.
