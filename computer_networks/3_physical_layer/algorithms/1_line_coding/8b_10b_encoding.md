### Overview of the 8B/10B Encoding Algorithm

The 8B/10B encoding algorithm is a line encoding technique used in digital communications, specifically in the Physical Layer of computer networks. Its purpose is to encode 8-bit data into 10-bit symbols for transmission. This encoding is widely used in high-speed communication protocols like Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and HDMI.

The primary objectives of the 8B/10B encoding algorithm are:

1.  **DC Balance**: Ensuring an equal number of 0s and 1s to avoid long strings of 0s or 1s, which can cause issues in AC-coupled systems.
2.  **Error Detection**: Making it easier to detect transmission errors by using specific patterns.
3.  **Clock Recovery**: Providing enough transitions to synchronize the transmitter and receiver clocks.

### Basic Principles of 8B/10B Encoding

1.  **Mapping 8-Bit Data to 10-Bit Codewords**: The algorithm takes 8-bit input data, splits it into a 5-bit and a 3-bit portion, and maps each portion to a 6-bit and a 4-bit codeword, respectively. This results in a 10-bit output.
    
2.  **Disparity Control**: Disparity refers to the difference between the number of 1s and 0s in the codeword. 8B/10B encoding uses **Running Disparity (RD)** control to keep the disparity close to zero. Running Disparity helps maintain DC balance and ensures reliable signal integrity.
    
3.  **RD+ and RD- Codewords**: For each 8-bit input, there are two possible 10-bit outputs: one with a positive disparity (RD+) and one with a negative disparity (RD-). The current running disparity determines which codeword to select.
    
    *   **Positive Disparity (RD+)**: When there are more 1s than 0s.
    *   **Negative Disparity (RD-)**: When there are more 0s than 1s.
4.  **Comma Characters**: 8B/10B encoding includes special characters known as comma characters, such as `K28.5`. These are unique bit patterns not found in regular data and are used for synchronization, frame alignment, and identifying the beginning of data streams.
    

### Step-by-Step Description of the Encoding Process

1.  **Divide the Input Data**: The 8-bit data byte is divided into a 5-bit section (most significant bits) and a 3-bit section (least significant bits).
    
2.  **Encode the 5-bit Section**: The 5-bit portion is encoded into a 6-bit output according to a lookup table. This table contains both RD+ and RD- codewords to maintain running disparity.
    
3.  **Encode the 3-bit Section**: Similarly, the 3-bit section is encoded into a 4-bit output using another lookup table. The choice between RD+ and RD- depends on the current running disparity after encoding the 6-bit portion.
    
4.  **Combine the Outputs**: The 6-bit and 4-bit encoded outputs are concatenated to form the final 10-bit encoded symbol. This symbol is then transmitted over the network.
    
5.  **Adjust Running Disparity**: The algorithm keeps track of the running disparity and adjusts it accordingly based on the transmitted codeword. If the RD+ codeword is chosen, the disparity is increased, and if the RD- codeword is chosen, it is decreased.
